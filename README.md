Yet Another JavaScript Unit Test

There are already many established JavaScript unit testing systems.

unit tests must be as powerful and succinct as possible... as little boilerplate as possible... and easily controllable... to isolate correct one giving you brief
    must be fast (parallel execution), vary trace easily.  quickly stop on errors
