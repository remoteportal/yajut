# YAJUT
Yet Another JavaScript Unit Test

There are already many established JavaScript unit testing systems, so why write yet another one?

Unit tests should be as powerful and yet succinct as possible.

YAJUT Features:
- easily write tests (as little boilerplate and wordy syntax as possible)
- easily specify set of tests to run
- easily vary trace classes
- easily set error mode (stop immediately on error or run to completion)
- as fast as possible (parallel execution and separate contexts for asynchronous tests)



# TODO
- rename to YAJSUT
- move all TODO items here
